/*Write a program to demonstrate Inheritance, where child classes reuse and extend the behavior of a parent class.

ðŸ”¹ Explanation

Inheritance allows one class to acquire properties & methods of another class.

Parent class (superclass) â†’ the general class (Vehicle).

Child class (subclass) â†’ the specific class (Car1, Bike).

>>> Benefits:

Code reusability

Easy maintenance

Logical hierarchy

>>> Types of Inheritance in Java:

Single (A â†’ B)

Multilevel (A â†’ B â†’ C)

Hierarchical (A â†’ B and A â†’ C)*/

// Parent class
class Vehicle {
	String brand;
	int speed;

	void drive() {
		System.out.println(brand + " is driving at " + speed + " km/h.");
	}
}

// Child class 1
class Car1 extends Vehicle {
	int numOfDoors;

	void showCarDetails() {
		System.out.println(brand + " has " + numOfDoors + " doors.");
	}
}

// Child class 2
class Bike extends Vehicle {
	boolean hasKickStart;

	void showBikeDetails() {
		if (hasKickStart)
			System.out.println(brand + " bike has a kick start.");
		else
			System.out.println(brand + " bike has only self-start.");
	}
}

// Main class
public class Inheritence_Example {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Car object
		Car1 car = new Car1();
		car.brand = "BMW";
		car.speed = 180;
		car.numOfDoors = 4;
		car.drive();
		car.showCarDetails();

		// Bike object
		Bike bike = new Bike();
		bike.brand = "Royal Enfield";
		bike.speed = 120;
		bike.hasKickStart = true;
		bike.drive();
		bike.showBikeDetails();
	}
}
